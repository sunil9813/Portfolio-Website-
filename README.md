# Getting Started with Create React App

Check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
<br />This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm start` - This runs the app in the development mode. To view the app in your browser go to <http://localhost:3000>, The page will reload when you make changes and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

* `npm test` - This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. *Read [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.*

* `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames includes hashes. Your app is then ready to be deployed! *Read [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.*

* `npm run eject` - This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. ***(Dangerous Command)*** 

> **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86501179/203784242-89100030-cfbf-4e62-bae9-a7551228ab54.png)
It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You never need to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel **obligated** to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
